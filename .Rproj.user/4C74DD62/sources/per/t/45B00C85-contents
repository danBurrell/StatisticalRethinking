# Before you start, you should do these things

We're working through the second edition of McElreath's Statistical Rethinking text. We need to access the associated \R\ pacakge `rethinking` and also load the `tidyverse`. 

```{r}
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
library(pacman)

p_load(coda, mvtnorm, loo, dagitty)
p_load_gh("rmcelreath/rethinking")
```
